Local verification:

```text
Python 3.13.5
templates/async_tasks.py → [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] + timeout (exit 0)
templates/run_subprocess.py → exit 0, stdout "hello"
templates/cli_app.py → parsed JSON and wrote out file (exit 0)
```

Notes:

- `subprocess.py` as a local filename shadows the stdlib; the template is named `run_subprocess.py`.
- Do not run `pytest` from a directory containing an unrelated `pytest.py`.
- The PyO3 template is illustrative and not compiled here.
